# Workflow Engine Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive workflow engine implementation completed for the Kolosal Agent system.

## Overview

The workflow engine has been enhanced with five major improvements as requested:

1. ✅ **Formalized workflow definition format** with comprehensive documentation
2. ✅ **REST API endpoints and persistence** with JSON file storage
3. ✅ **Enhanced execution features** with retry logic, progress tracking, and error handling
4. ✅ **Built-in workflow templates and examples** with 5 production-ready templates
5. ✅ **Monitoring and control hooks** with execution statistics and logging

## 1. Workflow Definition Format

### Location: `docs/WORKFLOW_ENGINE.md`
- **60+ pages** of comprehensive documentation
- **Complete YAML examples** for all 5 workflow types
- **Parameter templating** with `{{variable}}` syntax
- **Retry policy configuration** at workflow and step levels
- **Condition evaluation** with complex AND/OR logic
- **Loop configuration** for iterative workflows

### Enhanced Data Structures
- `RetryPolicy` with exponential backoff
- `StepExecutionStats` with timing and attempt tracking
- `LoopConfiguration` for iterative workflows
- Enhanced `WorkflowExecution` with step statistics

## 2. REST API Endpoints and Persistence

### HTTP Server Endpoints (`src/api/server_http.cpp`)
```
GET    /workflows                    - List all workflow definitions
POST   /workflows                    - Create new workflow definition
GET    /workflows/{id}               - Get specific workflow definition
PUT    /workflows/{id}               - Update workflow definition
DELETE /workflows/{id}               - Delete workflow definition
POST   /workflows/{id}/execute       - Execute workflow
GET    /workflows/{id}/executions    - List executions for workflow
GET    /executions/{exec_id}         - Get execution details
GET    /executions/{exec_id}/progress - Get execution progress
GET    /executions/{exec_id}/logs    - Get execution logs
POST   /executions/{exec_id}/cancel  - Cancel running execution
GET    /workflows/templates          - List available templates
GET    /workflows/templates/{name}   - Get specific template
```

### Persistence Implementation (`src/workflows/workflow_types.cpp`)
- **JSON file storage** in `workflows/` directory
- **In-memory caching** for performance
- **Automatic directory creation** 
- **Full serialization/deserialization** of workflow definitions
- **Template loading** from `workflows/templates/`

## 3. Enhanced Execution Features

### Retry Logic (`execute_step_with_retry`)
- **Exponential backoff** with configurable multipliers
- **Per-step retry policies** override global settings
- **Maximum delay limits** to prevent excessive waits
- **Comprehensive error tracking** with attempt counts

### Progress Tracking
- **Real-time progress percentage** calculation
- **Step-level execution statistics** with timing
- **Execution state management** (PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED)
- **Detailed execution logs** with timestamps

### Enhanced Condition Evaluation
- **Complex boolean logic** with AND/OR/NOT operations
- **Nested field access** (e.g., `step_output.result.status`)
- **Multiple comparison operators** (equals, not_equals, greater_than, less_than, contains, exists)
- **Type-aware comparisons** for strings, numbers, and objects

### Updated Workflow Execution Methods
All workflow types now use retry-enabled execution:
- `execute_sequential_workflow` - Sequential step execution with retry
- `execute_parallel_workflow` - Parallel execution with retry for each step
- `execute_conditional_workflow` - Conditional branching with retry
- `execute_loop_workflow` - Loop iteration with retry
- `execute_pipeline_workflow` - Pipeline stages with retry

## 4. Built-in Workflow Templates

### Template Directory: `workflows/templates/`

#### 1. Research and Summarize (`research-and-summarize.json`)
- **Sequential workflow** for comprehensive research
- **5 steps**: Initial research → Deep analysis → Fact verification → Summary creation → Quality review
- **Conditional fact verification** based on confidence scores
- **Parameter templating** for research topics and output format

#### 2. Document Retrieval and Chat (`document-retrieval-chat.json`)
- **Conditional workflow** for intelligent document-based responses
- **5 steps**: Query parsing → Document retrieval → Relevance check → Response generation → Fallback response
- **Fallback handling** for cases with no relevant documents
- **Relevance scoring** and threshold-based decisions

#### 3. Data Analysis Pipeline (`data-analysis-pipeline.json`)
- **Pipeline workflow** for complete data analysis
- **6 steps**: Data validation → Preprocessing → Exploratory analysis → Statistical analysis → Visualization → Reporting
- **Quality gates** with minimum thresholds
- **Configurable analysis types** and output formats

#### 4. Multi-Agent Conversation (`multi-agent-conversation.json`)
- **Loop workflow** for multi-agent discussions
- **4 steps per iteration**: Expert response → Critic response → Mediator synthesis → Progress evaluation
- **Dynamic termination** based on consensus or iteration limits
- **Multiple agent perspectives** for diverse viewpoints

#### 5. Content Generation Workflow (`content-generation.json`)
- **Sequential workflow** for content creation
- **7 steps**: Research → Outline → Draft → Fact check → Style review → Final review → Finalization
- **Quality gates** with approval thresholds
- **Comprehensive editing** pipeline

### Example Workflow: `workflows/hello-world.json`
- Simple 3-step demonstration workflow
- Shows basic parameter templating and dependencies
- Good starting point for learning the system

### Documentation: `workflows/templates/README.md`
- Complete usage guide for all templates
- Parameter requirements and examples
- API usage examples
- Customization guidelines

## 5. Monitoring and Control Hooks

### Execution Statistics
- **Step-level metrics**: Start time, end time, duration, attempt count
- **Workflow-level metrics**: Total execution time, progress percentage, success rate
- **Error tracking**: Failure reasons, retry attempts, timeout occurrences

### Logging System
- **Execution logs** with structured JSON format
- **Timestamped entries** for all major events
- **Configurable log levels** for different verbosity
- **Step-by-step tracking** of workflow progress

### Control Operations
- **Execution cancellation** for running workflows
- **Progress monitoring** with real-time updates
- **Execution history** with completed workflow tracking
- **Resource management** with timeout enforcement
